## ‚ùì What does the `core` package?

You can think of the `core` package as the brain of AgileTs.
It holds the `Agile Class` which is the main Instance of AgileTs and manages everything.
```ts
const App = new Agile();
```
Each Agile Sub Instance like [States](./features/state/Introduction.md), [Collections](./features/state/Introduction.md) ..
has it originates from a such main Agile Instance.
```ts
const MY_STATE = App.createState("Hello there");
```
It doesn't matter where you instantiate your main Agile Instance but for sure
each Application using AgileTs needs such an Instances.
But be aware that it isn't recommend having multiple Agile Instances in one single Application.
You might check out the [style guides](../../main/StyleGuide.md) to get some inspiration how to structure an Application using AgileTs.
