In this guide your learn, how to integrate and use AgileTs in a React Project.
I promise you, it's pretty easy.

## üîΩ Installation

To properly use AgileTs in a React Application, we have to install two packages. The `core` package, and a package that allows us to
integrate AgileTs into React, the `react` package.

### üìÅ `@agile-ts/core`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @agile-ts/core 
```

Let's start with the `core` package, which acts as the brain of AgileTs 
and manages all our [States](../packages/core/features/state/Introduction.md), 
[Collections](../packages/core/features/collection/Introduction.md), ..

### üìÇ `@agile-ts/react`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @agile-ts/react 
```

Now we continue with installing the `react` package.
Which is like an interface to React and provides useful Functions like [`useAgile`](../packages/react/features/Hooks.md#useagile) 
to bind our States to a React Component.

### üöÄ `create-react-app`

<Tabs
  defaultValue="javascript"
  values={[
  {label: 'Javascript', value: 'javascript'},
  {label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},
]}>

  <TabItem value="javascript">

     npx create-react-app my-app --template agile
   </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="typescript">

     npx create-react-app my-app --template agile-typescript
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you start a Project from scratch, you might use the `react-template` for AgileTs, which
automatically generates a react-app and installs AgileTs.
If you have chosen this way there is no need to follow the installation steps above.

## üí° Create first State

### ‚ùì What is a State
A State holds an Information that you need to remember at a later point in time.
It gets created with help of an [Agile Instance](../packages/core/features/agile-instance/Introduction.md) here called `App`.
```ts
const MY_FIRST_STATE = App.createState("Hello World");
```
After the instantiation it can be dynamically and easily manipulated.
```ts
MY_FIRST_STATE.set("Hello There"); // Set State Value to "Hello There"
MY_FIRST_STATE.undo(); // Undo latest change
MY_FIRST_STATE.is("Hello World"); // Check if State has a specific Value
MY_FIRST_STATE.persist(); // Persist State Value into Storage
```
You might use a State to remember which user is currently logged in or what theme is active right now.

### üî¥ Live Example

In this code snippet we create our first State üòÉ.
Below the Live Example you can find [some descriptions to important code snippets](#-important-code-snippets).

```tsx live
// Let's start by creating an Agile Instance
const App = new Agile();

// Now we are able to build our first State which has the intial value "Hello World"
const MY_FIRST_STATE = App.createState("Hello World");
let helloWorldCount = 0;

const RandomComponent = () => {
    // With the 'useAgile' Hook we bind our just created State to the 'RandomComponent'
    const myFirstState = useAgile(MY_FIRST_STATE);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{myFirstState}</p>
            <button
                onClick={() => {
                    // Here we just update our State Value
                    MY_FIRST_STATE.set(`Hello World ${++helloWorldCount}`);
                }}
            >
                Update State
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}

render(<RandomComponent/>);
```

### üíª Important Code Snippets

```ts
const App = new Agile();
```
Before we are able to create any State, we have to instantiate a AgileTs Instance.
Such an Instance holds and manages all our States, Collection, ..
Be aware that it's not recommended having multiple Agile Instances in one application!

```ts
const MY_FIRST_STATE = App.State("Hello World");
```
In this snippet we create our first State in AgileTs.
It was built from our previously instantiated AgileTs Instance and automatically got stored in it 
with an initial value of "Hello World".

```ts
const myFirstState = useAgile(MY_FIRST_STATE);
```
Here we use the `useAgile` React Hook to bind our State to a React Component.
This binding is necessary to rerender the Component whenever the State mutates, 
for instance if we change the value of the State.
`useAgile` returns the current `output` of our State.
Be aware that hooks can only be used in React Components!
For class component Users we have created the [AgileHOC](../packages/react/features/AgileHOC.md).

```ts
MY_FIRST_STATE.set(`Hello World ${++helloWorldCount}`);
```
To bring some life into our small Application we update the State with the `set` function
in which we just pass our desired new value.

## üí° Create first Collection

### ‚ùì What is a Collection
A Collection is like an array of object shaped data following the same pattern.
It gets created with help of an [Agile Instance](../packages/core/features/agile-instance/Introduction.md) here called `App`.
```ts
const MY_COLLECTION = App.createCollection();
```
After the instantiation it can be dynamically and easily manipulated.
```ts
TODOS.collect({id: "id1", todo: "Clean Bathroom"}); // Add new Data
TODOS.remove("id1").everywhere(); // Remove Data with the id 'id1'
TODOS.persist(); // Persist Collection Value into Storage
```
Be aware that each Collection Data needs an unique primaryKey like an `id` to be identifiable and
has to be an Object.
With the help of Groups we are also able to split our Collection into multiple parts,
without losing the redundant behavior.
```ts
const USER_TODOS = TODOS.createGroup("user-todos", ["id1", "id2"]); // TODOS of a specifc User
const TODAY_TODOS = TODOS.createGroup("today-todos", ["id3", "id2", "id5"]); // TODOS for Today
```
You might use a Collection to create a dynamically set of Todo-Objects.


### üî¥ Live Example

In this code snippet we create our first Collection üòÉ.
Below the Live Example you can find [some descriptions to important code snippets](#üíª-Important-Code-Snippets).

```tsx live
// Let's start by creating our Agile Instance 
const App = new Agile();

// Now we are able to build our first Collection
const TODOS = App.createCollection({
  initialData: [{id: 1, name: "Clean Bathroom"}]
});

const RandomComponent = () => {
    // With the 'useAgile' Hook we bind our first Collection to the 'RandomComponent'
    const todos = useAgile(TODOS);

    // Current Input of Name Form
    const [currentInput, setCurrentInput] = React.useState("");

    return (
        <div>
            <h3>Simple TODOS</h3>
            <input type="text" name="name" value={currentInput} onChange={(event) => {
                setCurrentInput(event.target.value);
            }}/>
            <button onClick={() => {
              // Add new Todo to the Collection based on the current Input
              TODOS.collect({id: generateId(), name: currentInput});
            }}>
                Add
            </button>
            {
                todos.map((value) =>
                    <div key={value.id}>
                        <p>{value.name}</p>
                    </div>
                )
            }
        </div>
    );
}

render(<RandomComponent/>);
```

### üíª Important Code Snippets

```ts
const MY_FIRST_COLLECTION = App.createCollection({
  initialData: [{id: 1, name: "Clean Bathroom"}]
});
```
To create our first Collection we need our previously instantiated Instance of AgileTs.
Then we are able to bring our first Collection to life, 
with one initial Item (_{id: 1, name: "Clean Bathroom"}_).

```ts
const myFirstCollection = useAgile(MY_FIRST_COLLECTION);
```
Here we are using the `useAgile` React Hook to bind our Collection to the React Component.
This binding is necessary to rerender the Component whenever the Collection mutates,
for instance if we change the value of the State.
`useAgile` returns the current `output` of our Collection.
Be aware that hooks can only be used in React Components!

```ts
 MY_FIRST_COLLECTION.collect({id: generateId(), name: currentInput});
```
To add new Data to our Collection, we cann use the `collect` function.
In this case we add the _currentInput_ to our Collection, with a random Id as primaryKey.
