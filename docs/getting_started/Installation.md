AgileTs is essentially a set of npm [packages](https://github.com/agile-ts/agile/tree/master/packages) that can be installed over npm.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >= 10.15.1 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn version`). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.

```bash npm2yarn
cd my-website
npm run start
```
